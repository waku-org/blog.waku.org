Building a chat protocol with the proper security parameters to protect its users during a hackathon is also highly challenging. Chat apps refer to person-to-person messaging apps, such as Telegram. But much of the functionality within Waku revolves around chat-like interactions. As Guru and V\xe1clav noted, in essence, Waku activities are akin to a chat interface, albeit one that transcends traditional UI constraints. Even sophisticated applications, such as that submitted by Mattia's team, are interactions between Waku nodes, where the data could range from simple text to more complex data like GPS locations."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Whether it is interactions between humans or machines, the core principle remains a form of chat.
